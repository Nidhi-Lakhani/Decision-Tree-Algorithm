# Decision-Tree-Algorithm

The task is to create a Decision Tree classifier for Iris data set and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. 

This is the third task for my internship at The Spark Foundation - Graduate Rotational Internship Program (GRIP) in the Data Science and Business Analytics domain.
